# Journey Through Space: Interactive Visualizations

## Overview

This interactive website takes you on a guided tour through humanity’s space exploration, from the interstellar voyages of Voyager 1 and 2, to the global surge of satellite launches, to the pressing challenge of orbital debris. Created for a data visualization course, this project showcases my work in crafting engaging narratives and interactive charts to illuminate space missions.

**My Contributions**:
- **Voyager Missions Trajectory (1977–2025)**: An interactive visualization tracing the paths of Voyager 1 and 2, highlighting their planetary discoveries.
- **Satellite Launches Timeline (1960–2023)**: A dynamic timeline charting launches by company, date, and success rate, reflecting the growth of space exploration.
- **Space Debris Pie Chart**: An interactive pie chart showing orbital debris by time interval and country of origin, emphasizing sustainability challenges.
